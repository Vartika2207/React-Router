NavList takes className not as regular prop but as a function which returns the className, this function received an object.
This object can destructured and isActive property is propvided by react-router-dom and isActive is a boolean.
This isActive is true the link is currently active where we defined it.
end prop is used with NavLink, which indicates that link should only be considered active if current active route ends with the path after url
otherwise it take active pages are those all page whose routes end with the url (/p will tale '/' and '/p' as active)
