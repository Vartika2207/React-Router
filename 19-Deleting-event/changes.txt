This EventItem.js is rendered in EventDetail.js hence here action will be added named action
Added redirect in EventDetails.js if response.ok is true.
Added as import under EventDetailPage named eventDelete and added it under eventDetailLoader's childern array.
In EventDetail.js configured action while sending delete request by adding method received from request argument provided in data object,
Now data can be submitted and trigger action programmatically.
