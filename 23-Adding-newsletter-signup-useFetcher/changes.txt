
Updated App.js, MainNavigation.js, added Newsletter.js, NewsletterSignup.js
In NewsletterSignup.js can use Form which triggers action that belongs to currently active route.
But Form not used since newslettersignup is part of main navigation.
Instead used fetcher.Form which triggers an action but will not initialize route transition.
It should be used when wanted to trogger an action or loader with help of load function without 
navigating to the page to which loader belongs or page where action belongs.
