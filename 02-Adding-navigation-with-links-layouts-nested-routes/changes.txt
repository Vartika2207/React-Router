

Added MainHeader.js and Root.js, in Root.js has RootLayout component, which is used in App.js as a parent and wrapper route
and Home.js and Product.js are taken as child properties inside an array.

Here RootLayout component is wrapper and appears everytime in which ever route visited, hence here we
defined the MainNavigation component which will be rendered on all routes.
